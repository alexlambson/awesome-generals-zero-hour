# awesome-generals-zero-hour
As many community-made fixes, QoL updates, tools, links to guides, and modernizations as I can find for Command &amp; Conquer Generals: Zero Hour


Please note that I didn't make these fixes nor do I offer support for them;
I am just trying to consolidate the numerous fixes hidden away on discord servers and now defunct C&C fan websites (rip CNCDen)
