# awesome-generals-zero-hour
As many community-made fixes, QoL updates, tools, links to guides, and modernizations as I can find for Command &amp; Conquer Generals: Zero Hour


Please note that I didn't make these fixes nor do I offer support for them;
I am just trying to consolidate the numerous fixes hidden away on discord servers and now defunct C&C fan websites (rip CNCDen)

# Contributing

- Pull the repo, add your suggestion to the pulled repo, be it a: tool, fix, patch, guide, link to a mod, map, etc, then commit the change and open a pull request

- If you don't know how to use git, open an [issue](https://github.com/alexlambson/awesome-generals-zero-hour/issues) with a link to whatever you want me to add / update

- Message `alexwiwa` on discord and bug me to add the link or file. 

# "What happens if like you die or abandon us?"

Simple, just [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and continue my work. As long as github remains, these fixes will be here.
And since Microsoft owns github now, it will probably outlive all of us

# "Can you add a link to my tool / fix instead of adding it to the reo?"

Yes, if you'd prefer that. However, I would rather make you a contributor to the repo so it can be hosted here. 
I am worried about more fan sites going down and taking their knowledge and community contributions with them. 
The point of this repo is to have everything one would need to continue playing this game in 10, 20, or 30 years. 
I feel like this is a much more robust solution than personally hosted sites due to the nature of who owns github, the importance of its existance to large corporations, and the ease of replication that git affords us. 

If you're a creator for the ZH community, I will happily make you a contributor to this repo so you can use it for your hosting. 

# "Can you remove my creation from this repo?"

Yes, but it will not affect any forks of the repo or any local copies people may have. 

# "What mods should I use?"

I personally mainly play [Contra](http://contra.cncguild.net/oldsite/Eng/index.php)

However, there are many amazing mods for Zero Hour. 

To name a few (in no particular order):
- [Project Raptor](https://www.moddb.com/mods/project-raptor-the-foxtrot-code). This mod is great for being able to play the og Zero Hour with new stuff. Last I checked, the vanilla campaigns and skirmish missions work with Project Raptor since they only added things. 
- [Rise of the Reds](https://www.moddb.com/mods/generals-project-raptor-9118) live out your WWIII fantasies
